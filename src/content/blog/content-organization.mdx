import SamplePage from '@content/colophon.mdx?raw';
import NavLinksCmp from '@components/NavLinks.astro?raw';

## Introduction

If you follow most guides, or use most AstroJS templates, you'll see that basic
pages, like Home, About, Contact, etc. are static .astro components under the
[`src/pages/`](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/#_top)
directory. This org system works great. But where it falls short for me is in
automatic generation of a navigation menu. You can absolutely generate a nav
list from these pages. But what you *don't* get is the metadata, like the page's
title, nor the ability to curate the label in the menu.

Not without quite a bit of extra logic. Brittle logic.

What I've done in this website is setup my base pages like any other [Content
Collection](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#_top),
like blogs, or portfolio projects. This lets me define
some standard metadata like a hero image, navigation label, etc. in the
[yaml frontmatter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#_top).
Those pages are all authored in MDX or Markdown format. This is generally
great because I get the best of both Markdown and .astro components.

As such, all navigation menus you see on this site are generated from there.

## Friction points

One thing I wish was easier to deal with is local/component scoped styles in
.mdx files. That's trivial in .astro components. But you can't write `<style>`
tags in MDX. You have to import styles as a module like any other ES module.
Not a huge deal, but not as convenient. One could also use the MDX content page
as a shell and author the page's content in a .astro component and that would
work fine.

I know. I know. I could use CSS-in-JS. B-b-but I don't like it. I find
css-in-js to be a clumsy and unnecessary abstraction.

## Details

For the curious, here's my `'page'` content config:

```ts title="src/content.config.ts"
/**
 * Generic Image Zod type
 */
export const ZImage = z.object({
  featured: z.coerce.boolean().optional().default(false),
  image: z.string().url().or(z.string()),
  position: z.array(z.string().or(z.number())).optional(),
  altText: z.string().optional(),
  description: z.string().optional(),
  creditLabel: z.string().optional(),
  creditUrl: z.string().optional(),
});

export const page = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ base: './src/content/', pattern: '*.{md,mdx}' }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    navLabel: z.string().optional(),
    description: z.string().optional(),
    tagline: z.string().optional(),
    hero: z.optional(ZImage),
    level: z.coerce.number().optional().default(1),
    bodyClass: z.string().optional(),
  }),
});
```

A basic MDX content page (for the metadata):

<CodeBlock lang="mdx" filename="colophon.mdx">{SamplePage}</CodeBlock>

And my NavLinks.astro component that generates the navigation menu:

<CodeBlock lang="astro" filename="NavLinks.astro">{NavLinksCmp}</CodeBlock>

I hope you found this helpful and interesting!
