Lots of things that used to require Sass or Less. Some of this is still only
possible with a post-processor like LightningCSS or PostCSS, but it is enabling
next-gen CSS specs now.

This site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and LightningCSS which
I've [written about](/blog/astro-lightningcss) recently.

I still miss the `@for` and `@each` directives in SCSS, though. Those are
awesome for generating boilerplate styles from a simple list or hash.

But I'm looking forward to this <MastoToot

Variable Groups</q> CSS draft spec from @leaverou`} /> maturing and becoming
a real thing to help with design systems in native CSS.
