## Introduction

Recently at work I faced an issue in which we needed to prevent user input in a search filter input from triggering additional REST requests in a search-as-you-type scenario. Initially I disabled the form while a request is in-flight, but this had the side-effect of stealing the User's focus which is a jarring UX.

We decided we wanted to keep the User's input focus, and let them continue typing, even if they type slower than the debounce time. To do this, I decided to implement an RxJS operator to handle the back-pressure and buffer the User input while a request is active, and then send another request then the previous request completes. it's not perfect, but I think it's a reasonably elegant compromise between a good UX and managing performance impact since the request is expensive on the backend.

## Core concepts

In this article we're going to look at RxJS's [`bufferToggle`](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/bufferToggle) and [`windowToggle`](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/windowToggle). Both operators are useful for controlling the flow of an Observable and managing the back-pressure.

[`bufferToggle`](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/bufferToggle) buffers values from an Observable until a condition is met, at which point it emits the buffered values as an array.

[`windowToggle`](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/windowToggle) creates a new Observable for each value emitted by the source Observable, and emits values from the new Observable until a condition is met, at which point it emits the values from the new Observable as an array.

## The code

```ts title="rxjs-traffic-light.ts"
/**
 * Pauses Observable traffic when the `roadBlock` observable emits true,
 * and resumes traffic when it emits false; and emits the most recent
 * emission from the source upon resuming.
 *
 * @param roadBlock - An observable that emits true or false to control
 *                    the traffic light.
 */
export function stopTrafficWhen<T>(roadBlock: Observable<boolean>): MonoTypeOperatorFunction<T> {
  const trafficLight = new Subject<boolean>();
  const redLight = trafficLight.pipe(filter((c) => !v));
  const greenLight = trafficLight.pipe(filter((c) => !!v));

  // Trigger the trafficLight when the roadBlock emits true or false. This
  // handles all kinds of sbujects and streams.
  roadBlock.pipe(
    distinctUntilChanged(),
    tap((v) => trafficLight.next(v)),
  ).subscribe();

  // You may want to add a distinctUntilChanged() or a
  // deepDistinctUntilChanged() after this operator to prevent duplicate
  // emissions.
  return (source: Observable<T>) => {
    return merge(
      source.pipe(bufferToggle(greenLight, () => redLight)),
      source.pipe(windowToggle(redLight, () => greenLight)),
    );
  };
}
```

## Going further

### Taking just the last source emission from the buffer

You can use the operator [`mergeMap`](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/mergeMap) to take just the last source emission from the buffer. My implementation at work adds this within `stopTrafficWhen`, but you can also add it in the pipeline after `stopTrafficWhen`.

### Debouncing

Now, when taking User input to search real-time (not requiring a button click), you should probably always debounce the input. This will prevent requests from firing on each keystroke, and instead wait for the User to stop typing for a short period of time (the debounce time) before sending the request. This is often somewhere between 400ms and 750ms.

You can use this operator here in conjunction with RxJS's [`debounceTime`](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/debounceTime) operator. Place it before or after `stopTrafficWhen` in the pipeline to use both. I like to debounce before stopping traffic.

Ok. I really just wanted to put "debounce before stopping traffic" out in the world! ðŸ˜œ
