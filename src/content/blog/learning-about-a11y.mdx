At work recently, I've been auditing our large and old code base to make accessibility updates to meet [<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (<q>guidelines</q> is redundant, I know) for our [<abbr title="Voluntary Product Accessibility Template">VPAT</abbr> document](https://www.section508.gov/sell/vpatet). For the rest of this post I'll be referring to accessibility as <q><abbr title="accessibility">a11y</abbr></q> because it's an industry convention.

Before I continue, let me take a moment and be clear about something: *I am in no way an expert in web accessibility.* I'm just interested in making the work I produce accessible to the widest audience I can.

So lets get back to it.

I've always been interested in a11y on the web in some capacity, but never read up on what that really means for Users of assistive technology. I just picked up tips and <q>best practices</q> along the way, like <q>always add `alt` attributes to images</q> and <q>use `aria-*` and `role` attributes to give semantic meaning to your documents.</q>

And now that I'm tasked with actually making our web app more accessible and after being on Mastodon for a while where there's a lot of discussion and expectation to make things accessible to more Users, I'm learning a lot more about the topc.

I'm taking this to heart and using this website as a sandbox for learning and applying WCAG guidelines. My goal is to incorporate accessible coding practices in everything I write.

On this site I've tried to make click/tap targets large enough to be more easily hit by Users with limited mobility or motor skills. I've used a larger default font size for easier readability. I've added 2 skip links, one for jumping to the main content of this site, and another for returning to the top of the page if you're scrolled farther down a page. These are all simple enough enhancements that make a difference to more Users. It just takes a shift in thinking on my part as the developer.

Some resources I've found invaluable in my a11y education, in no particular order:
