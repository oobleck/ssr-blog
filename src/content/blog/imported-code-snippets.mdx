## Introduction

<p class="lead">
  In my previous post, "[[content-organization]]" I wanted to include my actual component
  and config files and keep them up to date as this website evolves. You can't
  just import it in mdx files and drop it into a code block. MDX/Astro doesn't
  interpolate variables inside backtick code blocks.
</p>

I needed another solution.

While doing some research, I learned that [Vite has the
`...?raw` import directive](https://vite.dev/guide/assets#importing-asset-as-string)
which lets you import the raw contents of a file. Cool. Now I need to interpolate that inside a code block with syntax
highlighting and all that.

Astro provides a [`<Code
/>` component](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/syntax-highlighting/#code-) which wraps the passed content within a Shiki block.
Great, that's pretty straight forward.

Oh, but wait. That output is encoded. So `<` chars are encoded as `&lt;`, etc.
That's no good. To resolve that issue I pulled in `lodash-es/unescape`. Sure I
could roll my own decoder, but I don't want to maintain the hash of entities
to replace.

## The code

Here's the `<CodeBlock />` component I wrote (dynamically included, of course
ðŸ˜‰).

<CodeBlock lang="astro" filename="CodeBlock.astro">{CBComponent}</CodeBlock>

And this very file that uses it. So meta ðŸ¤¯
