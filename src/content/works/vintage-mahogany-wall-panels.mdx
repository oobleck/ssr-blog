In the summer of 2024, an Eichler home from 1960 was being flipped in the famous Fairglen Eichler neighborhood in Willow Glen and they tore out all of the original mahaogany wall paneling. It's akin to murder.

The wife and I spoke with the interim owner and acquired 10 4' x 8' panels in excellent condition. The 60-odd years of wear and tear had been kind to them. They must have been in a part of the home with little to no direct sunlight, which helped preserve their color.

Later, just before the new year, I installed sixteen feet of the panels in our family room. I had to cut a few utility holes for switches, outlets, and an HVAC register. That was nerve wracking because there was no room to screw up. I took my time, measured 3 times, and every hole I cut was accurate to within 1/8 of an inch. Plenty close for my needs.

These new panels add a wonderful depth and rich character to our family room and really push the 1970s space firmly into mid-century modern territory.
